### About Me

My name is Mark Rieke and I am a senior consumer experience (CX) analyst at [Memorial Hermann Health System](https://www.memorialhermann.org/) where I use survey data to improve patient satisfaction. I love making beautiful charts, working on home improvement projects, and playing jazzy piano.

I primarily use [R](https://www.r-project.org/) for my work. Some of my interests include:

* Machine learning & quantifying uncertainty;
* Effective communication via data visualization/data storytelling;
* Package development;
* Having fun with R!

I've written a few packages:

* ü•æ [**workboots**](https://markjrieke.github.io/workboots/) - a package for generating prediction intervals from a [tidymodel](https://www.tidymodels.org/) [workflow](https://workflows.tidymodels.org/)
* üê¶ [**nplyr**](https://markjrieke.github.io/nplyr/) - a grammar of (nested) data manipulation
* üóíÔ∏è [**riekelib**](https://markjrieke.github.io/riekelib/) - a collection of functions I use regularly

I sometimes write about projects I'm working on at [thedatadiary.net](https://www.thedatadiary.net/).
