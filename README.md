### About Me

My name is Mark Rieke and I am a Data Scientist at [Game Data Pros, Inc.](https://gamedatapros.com/) where I help to build systems for conducting and analyzing A/B tests from a Bayesian perspective. After hours and on weekends you can catch me building [swishbook](https://www.swishbook.com/), or playing jazzy piano.

I primarily use [R](https://www.r-project.org/) for my personal work. Some of my interests include:

* Bayesian inference via [Stan](https://mc-stan.org/);
* Survey analysis for people analytics/electoral forecasting;
* Data visualization design/storytelling with uncertainty;
* Package development.

I've written a few packages:

* ü•æ [**workboots**](https://markjrieke.github.io/workboots/) - a package for generating prediction intervals from a [tidymodel](https://www.tidymodels.org/) [workflow](https://workflows.tidymodels.org/)
* üê¶ [**nplyr**](https://jibarozzo.github.io/nplyr/) - a grammar of (nested) data manipulation (now maintained by [Bol√≠var Aponte Rol√≥n](https://github.com/jibarozzo))
* üóíÔ∏è [**riekelib**](https://markjrieke.github.io/riekelib/) - a collection of functions I use regularly

I sometimes write about projects I'm working on at [thedatadiary.net](https://www.thedatadiary.net/).
